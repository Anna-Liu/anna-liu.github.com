	<p class="text">Hello! I am a beginner with code but am interested in making full fledged software and applications one day. <br /><br />
	
	I was first exposed to the world of code (although it's not considered real code) around 2002 when my family finally got a personal computer and internet connection (yes, I know we were late). At that time I joined a children's website called Neopets where users are able to customized their own user lookup or pet pages with HTML and CSS. Through looking at small tutorials and people's own code and templates I learned the basics of HTML and CSS although I didn't really understand it at the time. One of my first full webpage was this one made in 2006: <a href="/neopets">a neopets pet page</a>. Not very impressive but at the time I thought it was so cool that I could link to different sections of the same page.<br /><br />
	
	In high school, I took an elective in Java programming. It was fun but the class did not go much in depth. We coded a simple guess the number and rock paper scissor game and created a holiday card with default shapes. I wanted to play around with it more after the class was over but I didn't know where to download the compiler from. <br /><br />
